## Hi there! I'm Ben.

I'm a Data Scientist in the retail sector with a passion for statistics, data science, and ML. I'm inquisitive and a self starter who's delivered strong business oriented results using Python, SQL, and R, focusing mainly on SQL and Python. I've got a strong knowledge of numerous libraries, including: numpy, pandas, sklearn, plotly, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow, and keras.

## LSTN app (WIP)

LSTN is an app I'm building that allows users to rate, post, and review music. The app features 4 pages: home, rate, rooms, and review. The home page will be a twitter like feed, that allows users to post their thoughts on new music. The rate page will allow users to search the Spotify API and rate albums out of 10, the rooms page will allow users to form communities to track eachothers scrores, averages, and behaviours. Finally the review page will be used to display listening stats for the user. The app is being built in React Native, and is currently a WIP. [Repo here](https://github.com/benfhicks/LSTN-App)
